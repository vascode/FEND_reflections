When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When my local files are messed up and I cannot figure out what happens
    When I don't have acess to local files

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    It may not need to keep locally because I may not work on it for a while or it is not something I manage frequently

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?

    fork is kind of clone but its concept is only applied to copying in github
    clone is to copy/download files. It can be done from local to local or remote to local. 
    branches are seperate space from master where I can expirement things.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

    I can easily know commit that I started from without knowing commit ID. And I can access to origin/master locally without internet access	

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier, and what would be harder?

    I will have to divide tasks before working on them so that we do not overlap what have been done.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master?  What benefits does each approach have?
