How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I just need to look at parts that are different between old and new  file because the change will most likely induced cause of the problem. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    This is kind of tracking system so that I don't need to track all the files I created

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pro: I can have more control on when to save things along with comments so that I can know later what version of file had what changes. 
    con: I may lose changes if computer lose power.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because what I desired to change could be done by combination of changes in multiple files. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log : to see history of actions taken
    git diff: to see difference between files

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can revert changes

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    make branch, merge it to master, push it to repo in github
